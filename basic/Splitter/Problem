"Splitter" is an tool which converts natural numbers. It has two commands: "Subtract 1" and "Divide by 2". The first command reduces the number by 1, the second command reduces the number twice if it is even otherwise an error occurs.

Given two natural numbers A and B (A> B). Write an algorithm for the "Splitter" that converts the number A in the number B and at the same time contains the minimum number of commands. The algorithm commands must be output by one per line, the first command is denoted as -1, the second command as :2.
